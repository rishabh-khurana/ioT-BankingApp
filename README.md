# BankAssist

## Objective

Our ultimate goal is to allow customers to save time in the branch as customers want things to be
done quickly and efficiently. In turn, this frees up time for bank employees to focus their time on
human centric aspects of the branch, such as tasks that require creative thinking and innovation.
Furthermore, employees can also focus their time on providing a more fulfilling experience for
customers

## Background

IoT is an emerging technology in this day and age. Data can be retrieved from sensors, which in turn
can be used to produce useful insights for companies. By 2020, there will be over 26 billion
connected devices. Most banks use apps to create a more convenient for their customers and we are
looking to add it on by creating an app which will make queueing easier, making it a more pleasant
experience and hopefully getting branch tasks done quicker.

## Who is it for?

Developers - People who love to develop apps in order to satisfy the customerâ€™s needs.
Customers - People who love to book things via an app on the mobile
Banks - Will help their queueing system for their branches and trying to find ways to improve the
customer experience
